\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this talk I will focus on various operators in enumerative geometry. I will start with a classical enumerative geometry question, which leads to the subject of Schubert calculus. The combinatorics of the symmetric group will play a key role. I will also talk about the Demazure Lusztig operators in elliptic cohomology. They are defined using the theta functions on elliptic curves.
